Reflection

This project instilled a lot of respect in me for quant engineers, now I know why they are paid so much. I initially wanted to do an entire michealis-menten conversion, but just trying to figure out how to represent the standard curve was hard enough. But I am very happy with what I've done. The most fun part for me was figuring out JFileChooser and getting the computer to successfully read the file, because that made me learn a lot more about file pathways, and also about engineering a program to be more user friendly (in the original version of this project I tried to make it all in the terminal and the user was supposed to write the file pathway in - surprise surprise that rarely worked and wasn't intuitive). In the future, I'd like to come back to this project when I have a better understanding of the higher level math concepts in statistics, I would love to get more acurrate calculations than my current ones (it currently creates a relatively loose line of fit only using the highest and lowest data point) and also when I have a better understanding of how to import external libraries, because I struggled with using the apache math library
I do wish I had asked for help more, a lot of my issues with file management and importing external libraries probably could have been solved just by talking to someone with more computer experience.
